Metaphysics is the foundation of any scientific truth, however, it relies only on the basic assumption in the realm of metascience, which is now, might be considered as a pseudoscience.
The foundation of Science, with capital S, is metaphysics. However, a special type of metaphysics, which is somehow, axiomatic and mathematical.
The difference between the Metaphysics of Science and the Metaphysics of other branch relies upon the systematisation and rigidness of thoughts.
Therefore, we can see the metaphysics of science as some sort of Science of Science, which can be seen, too, as part of the paradigm, not outside it.

Science, with capital S, is the main paradigm that every certain Truth can be found inside it.
